# ðŸŽ² Cub3D ðŸŽ®

The objective is to create a basic 3D game engine inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D.
This project aims to make you dive into low-level programming, game development concepts, mathematical principles and algorithmic thinking.

## Features:
- Raycasting Engine: Implements raycasting to render in real time a 3D perspective view from a 2D map.
- Player Movement:  Handles keyboard events supporting basic player controls that allow movement and rotation within the game world.
- Texture Mapping: Adds textures to walls for a more realistic environment.
- Map Parsing: Reads and validates a map from a .cub file to generate the game world.
- Error Handling: Includes robust error management for edge cases in input and gameplay.

## Technologies:
- Programming Language: C
- Graphics Library: MLX42 (modern alternative to MinilibX, with better support and features)
- Operating System: Unix/Linux

## Usage:
* Compile the code using the `make` command
* Run `./cub3d`
* Enjoy the views!
